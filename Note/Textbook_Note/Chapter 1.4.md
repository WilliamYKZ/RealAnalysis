# Chapter 1.4 

## Definition

Let $S$ be a nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$

1. If $S$ contains a largest element $s_0$ [that is, $s_0$ belongs to $S$ and $s\le s_0$ for all $s\in S$], then we call $s_0$ the maximum of $S$ and write $s_0=maxS$.
2. If $S$ contains a smallest element, then we call the smallest element if minimum of $S$ and write it as $minS$.



### Example 1

Consider real number $a$ and $b$ where $a<b$. the following notation will be used throughout. 
$$
\begin{array}{ll}
{[a, b]=\{x \in \mathbb{R}: a \leq x \leq b\},} & (a, b)=\{x \in \mathbb{R}: a<x<b\} \\
{[a, b)=\{x \in \mathbb{R}: a \leq x<b\},} & (a, b]=\{x \in \mathbb{R}: a<x \leq b\}
\end{array}
$$
$[a,b]$ is called a closed interval, $(a,b)$ is called an open interval, while $(a,b]\ and \ [a,b) $ are called semi-open intervals.



### Example 2

The sets $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Q}$ have no maximum or minimum. The set $\mathbb{N}$ has no maximum, but $min\mathbb{N}=1$.



### Example 3

The set $\{r\in \mathbb{Q}:0\le r\le \sqrt{2}\}$ has a minimum, namely 0, but no maximum. This is because $\sqrt{2}$  does not belong to the set but there are rationals in the set arbitrarily close to $\sqrt{2}$.
