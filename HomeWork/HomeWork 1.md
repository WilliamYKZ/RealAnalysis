## Definition of Group

A group is a set $G$ together with a binary operation on $G$, here denoted $''.''$, that combines any two elemnts $a$ and $b$ form an element of $G$, denoted $a\cdot b$, such that the floowing three requirement, known as group axiom, are satisfied

1. Associativity: For all $a,b,c$ in $G$, one has $(a\cdot b)\cdot c = a\cdot (b\cdot c)$.
